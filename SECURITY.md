# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the BTC Trading Web application, specifically the migration from localStorage to secure cookies and additional security enhancements.

## Overview

The application has been migrated from using localStorage for token storage to secure HTTP-only cookies, providing better protection against XSS attacks and improved security posture.

## Key Security Improvements

### 1. Cookie-Based Authentication

**Before:** Tokens stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS attacks)
**After:** Tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies

#### Benefits:
- **XSS Protection:** HTTP-only cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, preventing token theft via XSS attacks
- **CSRF Protection:** SameSite=strict prevents cross-site request forgery attacks
- **Automatic Expiry:** Cookies have configurable expiration times
- **Domain Restriction:** Cookies can be restricted to specific domains

#### Implementation:
- Uses [cookies-next](https://github.com/andreizanik/cookies-next) library for cross-platform cookie management
- Secure cookie configuration with HttpOnly, SameSite, and domain restrictions
- Environment-specific settings (development vs production)

### 2. Token Validation

**Enhanced token validation:**
- JWT format validation (3 parts separated by dots)
- Minimum token length requirements
- Token sanitization before storage

### 3. User Data Sanitization

**Before:** Raw user data stored without validation
**After:** Sanitized user data with only necessary fields

#### Sanitized Fields:
- `id` (required)
- `username` (required)
- `email` (required)
- `created_at` (optional)
- `updated_at` (optional)

### 4. Security Headers

**Middleware-enforced security headers:**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Prevents XSS and other injection attacks

### 5. Route Protection

**Server-side route protection:**
- Protected routes require valid authentication cookies
- Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
- Prevention of authenticated users accessing auth pages

### 6. Migration Support

**Seamless migration from localStorage:**
- Automatic detection and migration of existing localStorage tokens
- Validation of migrated tokens
- Cleanup of old localStorage data
- Backward compatibility during transition

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Production domain for cookie restrictions
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com

# API base URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

### Security Configuration

All security settings are centralized in `src/lib/security-config.ts`:

```typescript
export const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  COOKIE: {
    AUTH_TOKEN_MAX_AGE: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days
    REFRESH_TOKEN_MAX_AGE: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
    SAME_SITE: 'strict',
    HTTP_ONLY: true,
  },
  // ... other configurations
};
```

## Cookie Structure

### Authentication Token Cookie
- **Name:** `auth_token`
- **Expiry:** 7 days
- **Security:** HttpOnly, SameSite=strict, Secure (production)

### Refresh Token Cookie
- **Name:** `refresh_token`
- **Expiry:** 30 days
- **Security:** HttpOnly, SameSite=strict, Secure (production)

### User Data Cookie
- **Name:** `user_data`
- **Expiry:** 7 days
- **Security:** HttpOnly, SameSite=strict, Secure (production)

## API Security

### Request Authentication
- Automatic token injection from cookies
- Token validation before API calls
- Automatic logout on 401 responses

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Automatic token refresh on expiration
- Graceful degradation on authentication failures

## Development vs Production

### Development
- Cookies: `secure: false` (allows HTTP)
- Domain: `undefined` (localhost)
- Debug logging enabled

### Production
- Cookies: `secure: true` (HTTPS only)
- Domain: Restricted to `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
- Strict security headers
- CSP enforcement

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only necessary user data is stored
2. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security (cookies, headers, validation)
3. **Fail Securely:** Invalid tokens are cleared automatically
4. **Secure by Default:** Production settings are secure by default
5. **Input Validation:** All user data is validated and sanitized

## Monitoring and Logging

- Authentication failures are logged
- Token validation errors are tracked
- Migration events are recorded
- Security header violations are monitored

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limiting
2. **Audit Logging:** Enhanced security event logging
3. **Token Rotation:** Automatic token refresh mechanisms
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Additional authentication factors
5. **Session Management:** Advanced session tracking and management

## Testing

### Security Testing Checklist
- [ ] XSS protection (cookies not accessible via JavaScript)
- [ ] CSRF protection (SameSite cookie validation)
- [ ] Token validation (format and expiry checks)
- [ ] Route protection (unauthorized access prevention)
- [ ] Data sanitization (user data validation)
- [ ] Security headers (browser security enforcement)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cookies not being set:**
   - Check browser cookie settings
   - Verify domain configuration
   - Ensure HTTPS in production

2. **Authentication failures:**
   - Validate token format
   - Check cookie expiration
   - Verify API endpoint availability

3. **Migration issues:**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Check localStorage for old data
   - Verify migration utility execution
