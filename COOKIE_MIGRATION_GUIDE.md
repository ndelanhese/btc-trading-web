# Cookie Migration Guide

This guide explains the changes made to migrate from localStorage to secure cookies for authentication in your Next.js application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cookie Implementation (`src/lib/cookies.ts`)
- **Fixed async/await issues**: Removed unnecessary async operations for cookie reading
- **Improved error handling**: Added try-catch blocks for all cookie operations
- **Client-side compatibility**: Ensured cookies work properly in browser environment

### 2. Security Configuration (`src/lib/security-config.ts`)
- **Updated cookie settings**: Changed `sameSite` from 'strict' to 'lax' for better compatibility
- **Disabled HttpOnly**: Set to `false` to allow client-side access
- **Added maxAge**: Proper cookie expiration handling

### 3. API Client (`src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- **Synchronous cookie access**: Updated to use synchronous cookie reading
- **Improved error handling**: Better handling of authentication failures

### 4. Store (`src/lib/store.ts`)
- **Async login function**: Made login function properly async
- **Initialization tracking**: Added `isInitialized` state to prevent premature redirects
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for cookie operations

### 5. Auth Provider (`src/components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`)
- **Async initialization**: Proper async handling of auth initialization
- **Migration support**: Better integration with localStorage migration

### 6. Login Form (`src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`)
- **Async login handling**: Proper async/await for login operations
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 7. Dashboard (`src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`)
- **Loading states**: Added proper loading states during initialization
- **Debug functionality**: Added debug tab to verify cookie functionality

## Testing Your Implementation

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try to access `/dashboard` - you should be redirected to `/login`
4. Login with valid credentials
5. You should be redirected to `/dashboard` and stay logged in

### 2. Cookie Verification
1. After logging in, open browser developer tools
2. Go to Application/Storage tab â†’ Cookies
3. Verify these cookies exist:
   - `auth_token`
   - `user_data`
   - `refresh_token` (if applicable)

### 3. Debug Tab
1. After logging in, go to the "Debug" tab in the dashboard
2. Click "Check Cookie State"
3. Verify all cookies are present and store state is correct

### 4. Persistence Test
1. Login successfully
2. Close the browser completely
3. Reopen and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
4. You should still be logged in

### 5. Logout Test
1. Click logout in the dashboard
2. Verify you're redirected to login page
3. Check that cookies are cleared in browser dev tools
4. Try accessing `/dashboard` - should redirect to login

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cookies not being set"
**Solution**: 
- Check that `HttpOnly` is set to `false` in security config
- Verify `sameSite` is set to `'lax'` for development
- Ensure cookie operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks

### Issue: "Authentication state not persisting"
**Solution**:
- Verify `isInitialized` state is properly managed
- Check that cookie reading operations are synchronous
- Ensure proper error handling in store initialization

### Issue: "API requests failing with 401"
**Solution**:
- Verify auth token is being read correctly from cookies
- Check that token validation is working
- Ensure API client is properly adding Authorization header

### Issue: "Infinite redirects"
**Solution**:
- Check that `isInitialized` prevents premature redirects
- Verify authentication state is properly initialized before routing decisions
- Ensure middleware is not conflicting with client-side auth

## Security Considerations

### Production Settings
When deploying to production, update these settings in `src/lib/security-config.ts`:

```typescript
ENVIRONMENT: {
  PRODUCTION: {
    SECURE_COOKIES: true, // Enable for HTTPS
    DOMAIN: 'yourdomain.com', // Set your domain
  },
}
```

### Cookie Security
- Cookies are set with `sameSite: 'lax'` for compatibility
- `secure: true` in production for HTTPS-only
- Proper expiration times set
- Token validation before storage

## Migration from localStorage

The migration system automatically:
1. Checks for existing localStorage data
2. Migrates valid data to cookies
3. Clears localStorage after successful migration
4. Re-initializes authentication state

## Next.js Best Practices Followed

1. **Server-side rendering compatibility**: Proper handling of SSR vs client-side
2. **Middleware integration**: Cookie-based authentication in middleware
3. **Error boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling
4. **Loading states**: Proper loading states during initialization
5. **Security headers**: Security headers configured in middleware

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check if cookies are working:
```javascript
// In browser console
document.cookie // Should show your auth cookies
```

### Verify cookie configuration:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Cookies enabled:', navigator.cookieEnabled);
```

### Test cookie operations:
```javascript
// In browser console
import { tokenCookies } from './src/lib/cookies';
console.log('Auth token exists:', tokenCookies.hasAuthToken());
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Use the Debug tab in the dashboard
3. Verify cookie settings in browser dev tools
4. Check that all async operations are properly awaited
5. Ensure proper error handling is in place
